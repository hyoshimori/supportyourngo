# Le Wagon Team Project - Funding Platform

This is a platform that connects companies and NGOs that need funding for their projects. The application is a team project created by a team of students from Le Wagon.

## Dependencies

The application was built using the following primary dependencies:

- `rails`: The primary dependency of your application, which provides the framework for building web applications in Ruby.
- `devise`: A popular gem for implementing user authentication and authorization in Rails.
- `faker`: A library for generating fake data, which can be helpful for populating your database with test data.
- `autoprefixer-rails`: A gem for automatically adding vendor prefixes to CSS styles, which helps ensure cross-browser compatibility.
- `font-awesome-sass`: A Sass-powered version of the Font Awesome icon library.
- `simple_form`: A gem that provides a simple and flexible way to build forms in Rails.

## Front-End

The front-end team designed the home page, dashboard, project show page, and contribution show page, with additional features such as a pull-down burger menu, a dashboard displaying all backend information, and a personal YouTube video section. We used pure Vanilla CSS for most of the design and Figma and Whimsical for designing.

## Back-End

The back-end team implemented a dashboard, seed data, database schema, validations, authentications, authorizations, and search function with additional features such as project and expense tracking, and a time counter for precise creation time. We used Ruby on Rails along with Stimulus for the JavaScript framework.
